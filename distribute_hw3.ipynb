    ">..**dynamic programming**, which typically removes one element from the problem, solves the smaller problem, and then uses the solution to this smaller problem to add back the element in the proper way. **Divide-and-conquer** instead splits the problem in (say) halves, solves each half, then stitches the pieces back together to form a full solution.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Dynamic programming is a technique for efficiently implementing a recursive algorithm by storing partial results. The trick is seeing whether the naive recursive algorithm computes the same subproblems over and over and over again. If so, storing the answer for each subproblems in a table to look up instead of recompute can lead to an efficient algorithm. Start with a recursive algorithm or definition. Only once we have a correct recursive algorithm do we worry about speeding it up by using a results matrix. Dynamic programming is generally the right method for optimization problems on combinatorial objects that have an inherent left to right order among components. Left-to-right objects includes: character strings, rooted trees, polygons, and integer sequences."

Then it gradually goes up, and after that every time when caculating fib_recursive(n-2), it does not need to go into the original fib_recursive function because it's already cached while calculating fib_recursive(n-1) on the left of the formula.
